        <h1>Recommended Readings</h1>
        <p>
		Of all people in a child's life, parents have the strongest
		influence on the child.  They do so much more than provide
		the basic necessities.  They are teachers; they are advocates:
		they are comforters; they are nurturers, they are confidantes,
		etc., etc., etc.  Filling these roles can be daunting for any
		parent.  At times, filling these roles as the parent of a
		child with a disability can seem overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
		Even though being the parent of a child with a disability can
		be a tough and demanding job, the job can be easier if the
		parents have the right information and skills.  I often provide
		trainings to parents of children with disabilities, and I
		realize that I cannot give them all the information and skills
		they need in one of my trainings.  As such, I provide the
		parents with a list of recommended readings so that they can
		continue to build their skills.  That list is below.  
        </p>
        <p>
		For each reading, I give an approximate price.  Most prices are
		taken from <a href="http://www.amazon.com">amazon.com</a> and
		do not include shipping and handling. [Note: Links to the books
		through Amazon are provided for the reader's convenience. We do
		not collect any advertisement revenue.]
        </p>
        <p>
		I also rate each reading as to how easily it is understood by
		laypeople, meaning people who are not professionals in the
		field (e.g., parents, grandparents, daycare providers).  The
		following are what the ratings mean.
        </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Very layperson friendly: This means that I think that most parents will be able to understand it quite well.  There is little or no professional jargon and the concepts in the reading are presented very clearly.</li>
		<li>Moderately layperson friendly: This means that I think that parents can understand it well; however, there may be a little professional jargon or occasional concepts requiring a some specific background knowledge.</li>
		<li>Somewhat layperson friendly: This means that I think that it contains some concepts and vocabulary that require some specific background knowledge on the part of the parent, or it require some assistance from a person with that background in order for a layperson to fully understand it.  Please note that the reader does not need to be a professional to understand these readings.</li>

	<h2>Communication-Based Intervention for Problem Behavior: A user's guide for producing positive change</h2>
	<p>
		The first author is Edward G. Carr.  The book is published by Brookes Publishing, which is a great publisher for materials concerning individuals with disabilities.

For example, a person who has used aggression to get attention might be taught how to approach a person and greet the person in order to get attention.</li>

	<h2>The New Social Story Book: Illustrated Edition</h2>
	<p>
		Written by Carol Gray.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This book is intended for use with children with autism, but it is likely that this approach will work for children and adults with and without disabilities.  These books provide a number of stories that help a child understand what is going to occur in a situation and what is expected of the child in that situation.  Social stories essentially give the child a script for how to behave in a situation. The stories can be read to the child or read by the child.  In addition, instructions are provided for writing social stories for situations that are not covered in the book.</li>
		<li>This book is very layperson friendly.  "The New Social Story Book: Illustrated Edition" costs about $24.</li>
