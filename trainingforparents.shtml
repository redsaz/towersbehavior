<h4>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h4>



        
<p>
A functional behavior assessment (FBA) is often needed to guide
development of interventions for problem behavior. The participants in
this course will learn: </p>



        
<ul>



          <li>What an FBA is</li>



          <li>How to determine if a child should have an FBA</li>



          <li>How to determine if an adequate FBA has been conducted</li>



          <li>How to determine if the results of the FBA are being used appropriately to guide intervention</li>



        
</ul>




        
<h4>INTENDED AUDIENCES</h4>



        
<p>
Parents, foster-parents, childcare workers, professionals,
paraprofessionals, and any other individuals wishing to learn the
basics of the assessment of behavior. </p>




        
<h4>PREREQUISITES</h4>



        
<p>
Participants should have had experience with individuals with problem
behavior. The participants should be capable learners. </p>

<h2 id="early-intervention">Early intervention: How parents can make a dramatic, lifelong difference in the life of a child with a disability</h2>



 
        
<h4>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h4>



        
<p>
Considerable research has demonstrated that effective early
intervention for individuals with disabilities yields very strong
positive results throughout that individual's life. Parents are a
child's first teachers, and, as such, they can have considerable impact
on how the child will do throughout life. Effective instruction for
individuals with disabilities must be very well designed. This course
provides a thorough introduction to effective teaching techniques that
parents can use at home and that professionals and paraprofessionals
can use in their settings. </p>



        
<p>
        Topics in the course include:
        </p>



        
<ul>



          <li>Near errorless learning techniques</li>



          <li>Data-based instruction</li>



          <li>Teaching concepts</li>



          <li>Considerations
for teaching skills in each of the four stages of learning (i.e.,
acquisition, fluency, maintenance, and generalization)</li>



          <li>Shaping behaviors</li>



          <li>Teaching a socially appropriate skill to replace a problem behavior</li>



          <li>Modeling</li>



          <li>Prompting</li>



          <li>Maximizing practice opportunities</li>



        
</ul>




        
<h4>INTENDED AUDIENCES</h4>



        
<p>
Parents, foster-parents, childcare workers, professionals (e.g.,
special educators, regular educators), pre-service professionals,
paraprofessionals, and any other individuals working with children with
disabilities. </p>




        
<h4>PREREQUISITES</h4>



        
<p>
Participants should have had experience with children with
disabilities. The participants should be capable learners; the training
in this course is the equivalent of college course work. </p>




        
<h4>COURSE LENGTH</h4>



        
<p>
        Approximately thirteen hours
        </p>




        
<h4>Note</h4>



        
<p>
It is recommended that this course be followed in four to six weeks by
a problem-solving/troubleshooting session. In this follow-up session, I
will lead the group in troubleshooting any problems or difficulties
that the participants have encountered since the training. During this
session, the participants will profit not only by learning solutions to
their problems but will also profit by learning the solutions to
problems that others have encountered. </p>

<h2 id="functional-communication-training">Functional communication training</h2>




        
<h4>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h4>



        
<p>
At times, individuals with developmental disabilities will use problem
behavior (e.g., self-injury or physical aggression) to
communicate their needs and wants. Often the problem behavior is quite
effective in helping them to achieve their goals. Many people often are
left wondering: (a) why is the individual engaging in this behavior;
and (b) how can I help this individual keep from doing this? </p>



        
<p>
In this course, the participants will learn how to determine answers to both of those questions. The participants will:
        </p>



        
<ul>



          <li>Target a behavior of concern in a specific individual</li>



          <li>Collect direct observational data on that behavior</li>



          <li>Analyze the data to help determine the function of the behavior</li>



          <li>Design an intervention for the individual's targeted behavior</li>



        
</ul>



        
<p>
Although other types of interventions will be covered, the course will
focus primarily on the development of interventions that teach an
appropriate communicative behavior to replace the problem behavior.
Topics in this course include: </p>



        
<ul>



          <li>The functions of behavior</li>



          <li>The role of reinforcement in learning of behavior</li>



          <li>Extinction</li>



          <li>Direct observation of behavior</li>



          <li>Analysis of behavior</li>



          <li>Prompting</li>



          <li>Setting event/antecedent interventions</li>



          <li>Communicative replacement behavior interventions</li>



          <li>Non-communicative replacement behavior interventions</li>



          <li>Embedding</li>



          <li>Choice-making</li>



          <li>How to avoid and/or repair problems with maintenance of newly learned replacement behaviors</li>



          <li>How to avoid and/or repair generalization problems of newly learned replacement behaviors</li>



        
</ul>




        
<h4>INTENDED AUDIENCES</h4>



        
<p>
Parents/care providers for individuals with developmental disabilities;
professionals (e.g., special educators, regular educators, case
managers); and all other individuals providing support to individuals
with developmental disabilities. </p>




        
<h4>PREREQUISITES</h4>



        
<p> The
participants should have provided support to individuals with
developmental disabilities who have exhibited problem behavior. The
participants should be capable learners. The training in this course
will be equivalent to college coursework. </p>




        
<h4>COURSE LENGTH</h4>



        
<p>
Approximately thirty-two hours. Due to homework that will be
asked of the participants, the course should take place over a period
of no less than five weeks. </p>




        
<h4>Note</h4>



        
<p> I recommend that I
provide support to the participants while they implement the
interventions they design as a part of this course. </p>

<h4>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h4>



        
<p>
In this course, the participants will learn several techniques to
increase a child's compliance. During the course, the participants will
be given opportunities to practice these techniques and will receive
feedback so that they can master the techniques. </p>



        
<p>
        Participants will be taught how to avoid scenarios like the following:<br>



        Parent: &ldquo;Sam, wouldn't you like to take out the trash?&rdquo;<br>



        Sam acts as if he didn't hear the request.<br>



        Parent: &ldquo;Please Sam, won't you take out the trash.&rdquo;<br>



        Sam: &ldquo;I'm in the middle of this video game. I'll get to it later.&rdquo;<br>



        Parent raising his voice: &ldquo;Sam, you'd better do it right now, or else.&rdquo;<br>



        Sam: &ldquo;Oh dad, if I do it now, I'll have to start the game over. Can't Barby do it?&rdquo;<br>



        Parent yelling: &ldquo;I'm fed up with you never doing anything around here!&rdquo;<br>



Sam throws a book against the wall and yells, &ldquo;Nobody in this
house understands me! Everyone is always picking on me!&rdquo;<br>



        Parent yelling: &ldquo;Alright, never mind!&rdquo;<br>



        Sam calms down and returns to his game.<br>



        The parent leaves and takes out the trash himself.<br>



        </p>

As children become older, timeout as a disciplinary measure becomes
less and less appropriate. In this interactive course, the participants
will learn alternative techniques for disciplining children in their
