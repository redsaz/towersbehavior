<h4>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h4>


        
<p>
        Very difficult students require a great deal of structure. In this
        course, the participants will learn how to design points and levels
        systems that provide the amount and type of structure that these
        individuals require.
        </p>



        
<h4>INTENDED AUDIENCES</h4>


        
<p>
        Education professionals; education paraprofessionals; professionals
        from education related disciplines (e.g., occupational therapists,
        physical therapists, and speech-language pathologists); professionals
        from other fields (e.g., social welfare professionals and mental health
        professionals); pre-service professionals in these fields; case
        managers; managers of facilities that serve individuals with problem
        behavior; and direct care providers for individuals with problem
        behavior.
        </p>



        
<h4>PREREQUISITES</h4>


        
<p>
        Participants should have had experience with individuals who exhibit
        problem behavior. The participants should be capable learners; this
        course is the equivalent of college course work.
        </p>



        
<h4>COURSE LENGTH</h4>


        
<p>
        Approximately nine hours.
        </p>



        
<h4>Note</h4>


        
<p>
I strongly recommended that this course be followed by one or two
troubleshooting/problem solving sessions in which the participants
return with questions/problems that have come up since they have
implemented their points/levels systems. I will lead the group in
troubleshooting each of the questions/problems. The participants will
profit not only by learning solutions to their problems but will also
profit from learning the solutions to problems that others have
encountered. </p>

<h2 id="functional-communication-training">Functional communication training</h2>


        
<h4>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h4>


        
<p>
At times, individuals with developmental disabilities will use problem
behavior (e.g., self-injury or physical aggression) to
communicate their needs and wants. Often the problem behavior is quite
effective in helping them to achieve their goals. Many people often are
left wondering: (a) why is the individual engaging in this behavior;
and (b)how can I help this individual keep from doing this? </p>


        
<p> In this course, the participants will learn
how to determine answers to both of those questions. To accomplish, the
participants will: </p>


        
<ul>


          <li>Target a behavior of concern in a specific individual;</li>


          <li>Collect direct observational data on that behavior;</li>


          <li>Analyze the data to help determine the function of the behavior; and</li>


          <li>Design an intervention for the individual's targeted behavior.</li>


        
</ul>


        
<p>
Although other types of interventions will be covered, the course will
focus primarily on the development of interventions that teach an
appropriate communicative behavior to replace the problem behavior. </p>


        
<p>
        Topics in this course include:
        </p>


        
<ul>


          <li>The functions of behavior
          </li>

  <li>The role of reinforcement in learning of behavior
          </li>

  <li>Extinction
          </li>

  <li>Direct observation of behavior
          </li>

  <li>Analysis of behavior
          </li>

  <li>Prompting
          </li>

  <li>Setting event/antecedent interventions
          </li>

  <li>Communicative replacement behavior interventions
          </li>

  <li>Non-communicative replacement behavior interventions
          </li>

  <li>Embedding
          </li>

  <li>Choice-making
          </li>

  <li>How to avoid and/or repair problems with maintenance of newly learned replacement behaviors

managers; managers of facilities that serve individuals with problem
behavior; and direct care providers for individuals with problem
behavior. </p>



        
<h4>PREREQUISITES</h4>


        
<p> The
participants should have provided support to individuals with
developmental disabilities who have exhibited problem behavior. The
participants should be capable learners. The training in this course
will be equivalent to college coursework. </p>



        
<h4>COURSE LENGTH</h4>


        
<p>
Approximately thirty-two hours. The course consists of six sessions of
between four and six hours per session. Due to homework that will be
asked of the participants, the course should take place over a period
of no less than five weeks. </p>
