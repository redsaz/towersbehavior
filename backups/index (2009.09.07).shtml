    <h1>Who I am</h1>
    <h3>Introducing Sam Towers</h3>
    <p>
     I am a behavior analyst and special educator who has spent sixteen
     years providing support to individuals with problem behavior. During
     this time, I have served as a behavior consultant to schools,
     departments of social services, early childhood programs, other
     organizations, and parents; I have served as a special educator; and I
     have trained special education teachers, other professionals, and
     parents. I have a Master of Arts degree and have completed three years
     of post-Master's training.
     Learn more about me and my <a href="qualifications.shtml">qualifications</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     I practice from the perspective of Applied Behavior Analysis
     (<a href="http://www.shapingbehavior.com/whatisaba.html">ABA</a>).
     The field of ABA approaches behavior scientifically. As such, ABA
     interventions have considerable research demonstrating their
     effectiveness.
