Compliance and Attitude: Improving Both in Your Child with a Disability
</h2>
<h3>Presented by the Autism Society of Colorado and Towers Behavior Services LLC</h3>

<br>
<br>
<p>
This course is designed for parents and others who wish to increase the compliance of children who have any type of disability.
</p>
<p>
In this course, the participants will learn several procedures for increasing the compliance of a child with a disability.  The participants will be given opportunities to practice these procedures and will receive feedback so that they are ready to use them when they complete the training.
</p>
<p>
Because timeout can be used in one of the procedures, using timeout effectively will also be covered in this training.  The following will be included in the timeout section of the training:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Considerations for using timeout.</li>
<li>How to solve problems commonly associated with timeout, such as a child refusing to go to timeout or a child screaming and tearing up things while in timeout.</li>
<li>What to do when a child becomes old enough that timeout is no longer appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This course lasts about 4 1/2 hours and will be offered three times in 2008, April 12th, July 25th, and November 22nd, from 10:00 a.m. until 3:30 p.m.
Each session will be held in the Autism Society of Colorado's training room, which is in the basement (level 1) of the First Bank building at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=550+S.+Wadsworth+Blvd,+Lakewood&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=44.25371,57.919922&ie=UTF8&ll=39.706427,-105.081482&spn=0.010549,0.014141&z=16&iwloc=addr">550 S.

Challenging Behaviors: Teaching Appropriate Alternatives<br />
or<br />
"What Could You Have Done Instead?"
</h2>

<h3>Presented by The Autism Society of Colorado and Towers Behavior Services LLC</h3>

<br>
<p>
This course is designed for parents and others who wish to decrease problem behavior in children who have any type of disability.
</p><p>
Often, when as individual with a disability uses problem behavior, the goal that the person is trying to accomplish is appropriate, but the way in which the person is trying to accomplish it is not.  In these types of situations, a very effective approach to decreasing the problem behavior is to teach the person a skill to accomplish the goal appropriately, thus eliminating the need for problem behavior.  The behavior or skill that is taught to the individual is called a replacement behavior.  Teaching a replacement behavior is what parents are trying to do when they ask a child, "What could you have done instead?"
</p>
<p>
The participants in this course will learn the skills necessary for teaching replacement behaviors and other interventions for decreasing problem behavior.  Among the skills to be taught in this course will be:
<ul>
 <li>How and when to teach replacement behaviors.</li>
 <li>How to understand what your child is attempting to accomplish through problem behavior, or, in other words, how to understand what your child is communicating through problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to respond to this communication so that you don't encourage further problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How problem behavior is triggered.</li>
 <li>How to reduce the number of triggers for problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How your actions, including well-meaning actions, can encourage problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to change your actions so that you don't encourage problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How situations in the environment can set up your child for problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to change these situations so that your child is less likely to use problem behavior.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This course is a "hands-on" course meaning that the participants will be given the opportunity to practice the skills they learn in this course.  These skills will include the following:
<ul>
 <li>Targeting a behavior of concern in a specific individual.</li>
 <li>Collecting direct observational data on that behavior.</li>
 <li>Analyzing the data to help determine the function of the behavior.</li>
 <li>Designing and implementing an intervention for the individual's targeted behavior.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This course is an intensive course, lasting for a total of five sessions of six-hour each.  This course will be offered once during 2008, on May 3rd, May 10th, May 31st, June 7th, and June 14th.  Please note that you need to attend all five sessions in order to complete the course.
