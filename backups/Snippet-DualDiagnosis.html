<h3>Presented by The Autism Society of Colorado, the Mile High Down Syndrome Association, and Sam Towers</h3>

<br>
<p>
Providing support to an individual with Down Syndrome, Fragile X Syndrome, or another developmental disability can be challenging; however, if the person also has Autism, providing support can be even more difficult.
</p><p>
This course is designed for parents, professionals, and other caregivers who wish to decrease problem behavior in individuals who have Autism and another developmental disability.
</p>
<p>
The participants in this course will learn what motivates individuals in this population to use problem behavior and what can be done to decrease the problem behavior.
</p>
<p>
The following will be taught in this course:
<ul>
 <li>The three core characteristics of autism and how they affect behavior.</li>
 <li>Characteristics commonly associated with autism and how they affect behavior.</li>
 <li>How your actions, including well-meaning actions, can encourage problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to change your actions so that you don't encourage problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How situations in the environment can set up your child for problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to change these situations so that your child is less likely to use problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How problem behavior is triggered.</li>
 <li>How to reduce the number of triggers for problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to understand what your child is communicating through problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to respond to this communication so that you don't encourage further problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to take direct observational data and analyze it. This will include practice during class using video clips of problem behavior.</li>
</ul>
</p>
