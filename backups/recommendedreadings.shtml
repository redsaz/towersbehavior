        <h1>Recommended Readings</h1>
        <p>
		Of all people in a child's life, parents have the strongest
		influence on the child.  They do so much more than provide
		the basic necessities.  They are teachers; they are advocates:
		they are comforters; they are nurturers, they are confidantes,
		etc., etc., etc.  Filling these roles can be daunting for any
		parent.  At times, filling these roles as the parent of a
		child with a disability can seem overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
		Even though being the parent of a child with a disability can
		be a tough and demanding job, the job can be easier if the
		parents have the right information and skills.  I often provide
		trainings to parents of children with disabilities, and I
		realize that I cannot give them all the information and skills
		they need in one of my trainings.  As such, I provide the
		parents with a list of recommended readings so that they can
		continue to build their skills.  That list is below.  
        </p>
        <p>
		For each reading, I give an approximate price.  Most prices are
		taken from <a href="http://www.amazon.com">amazon.com</a> and
		do not include shipping and handling. [Note: Links to the books
		through Amazon are provided for the reader's convenience. We do
		not collect any advertisement revenue.]
        </p>
        <p>
		I also rate each reading as to how easily it is understood by
		laypeople, meaning people who are not professionals in the
		field (e.g., parents, grandparents, daycare providers).  The
		following are what the ratings mean.
        </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Very layperson friendly: This means that I think that most parents will be able to understand it quite well.  There is little or no professional jargon and the concepts in the reading are presented very clearly.</li>
		<li>Moderately layperson friendly: This means that I think that parents can understand it well; however, there may be a little professional jargon or occasional concepts requiring a some specific background knowledge.</li>
		<li>Somewhat layperson friendly: This means that I think that it contains some concepts and vocabulary that require some specific background knowledge on the part of the parent, or it require some assistance from a person with that background in order for a layperson to fully understand it.  Please note that the reader does not need to be a professional to understand these readings.</li>

	<p>
	This is an edited book.  The editors are Catherine Maurice, Gina Green, and Stephen Luce.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This book addresses interventions for young children with autism, but it is also great use with older children and adults with autism.  It is also great for use with individuals with other developmental disabilities.  This book primarily addresses the teaching of skills through an ABA (applied behavior analysis) approach.  It is rich with information about how parents can teach at home and how to work with professionals to ensure appropriate services.</li>

	<h2>Communication-Based Intervention for Problem Behavior: A user's guide for producing positive change</h2>
	<p>
		The first author is Edward G. Carr.  The book is published by Brookes Publishing, which is a great publisher for materials concerning individuals with disabilities.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This book is good for use with those with developmental disabilities, including autism. The first few chapters outline a process for conducting a functional behavior assessment. The rest is an excellent "How to Guide" for teaching a replacement behavior.  A replacement behavior is an appropriate behavior that an individual uses to achieve a goal instead of using a problem behavior to achieve that goal.  For example, a person who has used aggression to get attention might be taught how to approach a person and greet the person in order to get attention.</li>
		<li>This book is moderately parent-friendly and costs about $25.00.</li>
		<li>Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Communication-Based-Intervention-Problem-Behavior-Producing/dp/1557661596/ref=sr_1_1/103-5965123-6827032">Communication-Based Intervention for Problem Behavior</a> ISBN-13: 978-1557661593</li>

	<h2>My Social Stories Book</h2>
	<div style="text-align:center;">and</div>
	<h2>The New Social Stories Book: Illustrated Edition</h2>
	<p>
	Both books are written by Carol Gray.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>These books are intended for use with children with autism, but it is likely that this approach will work for children with other developmental disabilities.  These books provide a number of stories that help a child understand what is going to occur in a situation and what is expected of the child in that situation.  Social stories essentially give the child a script for how to behave in a situation. The stories can be read to the child or read by the child.  In addition, instructions are provided for writing social stories for situations that are not covered in the books.  Examples of situations covered in the book are: (a) what to do when getting a haircut; (b) how to deal with thunder; (c) how to take medicine; and (d) eating at a table.</li>
		<li>These books are very layperson friendly.  "My Social Stories Book" costs about $13.00.  "The New Social Story Book: Illustrated Edition" costs about $22.00.</li>
		<li>Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Social-Stories-Book-Carol-Gray/dp/1853029505/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-5965123-6827032">My Social Stories Book</a> ISBN-13: 978-1853029509</li>

	<h2>Autism Spectrum Disorders: Interventions and Treatments for Children and Youth</h2>
	<p>
		The first author of this book is Richard Simpson.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This book reviews all the current treatments for autism and is a "must read" book for parents, professionals, and others who are trying to determine which intervention(s) should be used for a person with autism.  For each treatment the book provides information about the following topics: (a) the age/ability level of the individuals for whom the intervention is designed; (b) a description of the intervention; (c) reported benefits of the intervention; (d) qualifications required to implement the intervention; (e) potential risks of the intervention; (f) price of utilizing the intervention; and (g) a rating that describes how well research supports the intervention.</li>
		<li>This book is moderately layperson friendly and costs about $76.00 in hardback or $36.00 in paperback.  Because of the cost and because some of the information will become dated over time, you might want to checkout a copy from a library or purchase it for use by a group.  The publisher is Corwin Press.</li>
