Why Won't You Mind?<br />
Compliance and Attitude: Improving Both in Your Child with a Disability
</h2>
<h3>Presented by the Autism Society of Colorado and Towers Behavior Services LLC</h3>

<br>
<br>
<p>
This course is designed for parents and others who wish to increase the compliance of children who have any type of disability.
</p>
<p>
In this course, the participants will learn several procedures for increasing the compliance of a child with a disability.  The participants will be given opportunities to practice these procedures and will receive feedback so that they are ready to use them when they complete the training.
</p>
<p>
Because timeout can be used in one of the procedures, using timeout effectively will also be covered in this training.  The following will be included in the timeout section of the training:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Considerations for using timeout.</li>
<li>How to solve problems commonly associated with timeout, such as a child refusing to go to timeout or a child screaming and tearing up things while in timeout.</li>
<li>What to do when a child becomes old enough that timeout is no longer appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This course lasts about 4 1/2 hours and will be offered three times in 2008, April 12th, July 25th, and November 22nd, from 10:00 a.m. until 3:30 p.m.
Each session will be held in the Autism Society of Colorado's training room, which is in the basement (level 1) of the First Bank building at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=550+S.+Wadsworth+Blvd,+Lakewood&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=44.25371,57.919922&ie=UTF8&ll=39.706427,-105.081482&spn=0.010549,0.014141&z=16&iwloc=addr">550 S. Wadsworth Blvd, Lakewood</a>.
