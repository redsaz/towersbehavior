<h3>Presented by The Autism Society of Colorado and Sam Towers</h3>

<br>
<p>
Many individuals with disabilities do not learn social skills readily through the course of natural social interactions.  This can hinder their interactions with others and their ability to make friends.
</p><p>
This course is designed for parents, professionals, and other caregivers who wish to increase the positive social interactions of an individual with a disability.
</p><p>
Among the topics that will be covered are:
<ul>
 <li>How to determine which social skills to teach.</li>
 <li>How to prompt social skills effectively.</li>
 <li>How to provide effective feedback.</li>
 <li>How to use role-playing.</li>
 <li>How to use social stories.</li>
 <li>How to set up opportunities for practicing social skills.</li>
 <li>How to help the individual make friends.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This course will be offered from 9:30 to 4:30 on December 5, 2009.
</p><p>
All sessions will be held in the Autism Society of Colorado's training room, which is in the basement (level 1) of the First Bank building at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=550+S.+Wadsworth+Blvd,+Lakewood&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=44.25371,57.919922&ie=UTF8&ll=39.706427,-105.081482&spn=0.010549,0.014141&z=16&iwloc=addr">550 S.
