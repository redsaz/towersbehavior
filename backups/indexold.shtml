<h1>Who I am</h1>


<h3>Introducing Sam Towers</h3>


<p>I am a behavior analyst and special educator who has spent
sixteen
years providing support to individuals with problem behavior. During
this time, I have served as a behavior consultant to schools,
departments of social services, early childhood programs, other
organizations, and parents; I have served as a special educator; and I
have trained special education teachers, other professionals, and
parents. I have a Master of Arts degree and have completed three years
of
post-Master's training. &nbsp;Learn more about me and my <a href="qualifications.shtml">qualifications</a>. </p>


<p> I practice from the perspective of Applied Behavior Analysis (<a href="http://www.shapingbehavior.com/whatisaba.html">ABA</a>).
The field of ABA approaches behavior scientifically. As such, ABA
interventions have considerable research demonstrating their
effectiveness. </p>


<p>You can <a href="contact.shtml">contact me</a>
through email, phone, and/or fax. </p>
