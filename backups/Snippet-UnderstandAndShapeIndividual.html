<h2 id="understandandshapeindividual">Understanding and Shaping the Behavior of Individual with a Disability</h2>

<h3>Presented by The Autism Society of Colorado and Towers Behavior Services LLC</h3>

<br>
<p>
Providing support to an individual with a disability can be challenging at times. It can be even more difficult if the individual uses problem behavior.
</p><p>
This course is designed for parents, professionals, and other caregivers who wish to decrease problem behavior in individuals who have a disability.
</p><p>
The participants in this class will learn to understand what motivates individuals to use problem behavior and what can be done to decrease the likelihood that problem behavior will be used.
</p>
<p>
The following will be taught in this class:
<ul>
 <li>How your actions, including well-meaning actions, can encourage problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to change your actions so that you don't encourage problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How situations in the environment can set up your child for problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to change these situations so that your child is less likely to use problem behavior.</li> <li>How problem behavior is triggered.</li> <li>How to reduce the number of triggers for problem behavior.</li> <li>How to understand what your child is communicating through problem behavior.</li> <li>How to respond to this communication so that you don't encourage further problem behavior.</li> <li>How to take direct observational data and analyze it. This will include practice during class using video clips of problem behavior.</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
