In-Home Interventions for Children with Autism and/or Another Developmental Disability
</h2>
<h3>
Presented by the Autism Society of Colorado and Towers Behavior Services LLC
</h3>

<br>
<p>
This class is designed for parents and others who wish to provide in-home
educational and behavioral interventions to children with autism and/or another
developmental disability.
</p><p>
Research has demonstrated that intensive intervention for children with
disabilities yields very strong positive results throughout the child's entire
lifetime. Parents and in-home services providers can be an essential part of
making a dramatic, lifelong difference in the lives of children with disabilities.
This course will provide the participants with the skills and knowledge
necessary to help build skills and decrease problem behavior in children with
disabilities. It will also provide them with the skills and knowledge necessary to
work with professionals who provide Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)
interventions in the home.
</p><p>
This course will provide training in the following areas:
<ul>
 <li>The core characteristics of autism and related characteristics of autism.</li>
 <li>Common characteristics of developmental disabilities.</li>
 <li>How to understand why problem behavior occurs and how to intervene.</li>
 <li>How to identify and change interactions of yours that might be triggering problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to identify and change situations in the environment that might be triggering problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to understand what your child is communicating through problem behavior and how to respond to this communication so that you don't encourage further problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to help your child build the skills necessary to function as
  independently as possible. Because building skills is so important for
  children with disabilities, approximately half of this course will be spent
  on this topic. Among the topics covered in this portion of the training will
  be:
  <ol>
    <li>how to motivate the learner;</li>
    <li>how to teach skills during the course of naturally occurring daily activities;</li>
    <li>how to teach replacement behaviors, which are skills that will allow the child to achieve his or her goals without using problem behavior;</li>
    <li>how to prompt effectively; and</li>
    <li>how to shape behaviors.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Early in the training, each participant will be taught how to take direct
observational data on problem behaviors. The participants will then be given the
opportunity to take data on a targeted behavior and bring the data back to class,
where we will analyze the data and discuss possible interventions.
</p><p>
This class is scheduled to occur from 9:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. on March 13,
March 20, March 27, April 17, and April 24, 2010, for a total of approximately 30
hours of instruction. It will occur in the Autism Society of Colorado's training
room, which is in the basement (level 1) of the First Bank building at
