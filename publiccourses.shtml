<h3>Presented by The Autism Society of Colorado and Towers Behavior Services LLC</h3>

<br>
<p>
Providing support to an individual with a disability can be challenging at times. It can be even more difficult if the individual uses problem behavior.
</p><p>
This course is designed for parents, professionals, and other caregivers who wish to decrease problem behavior in individuals who have a disability.
</p><p>
The participants in this class will learn to understand what motivates individuals to use problem behavior and what can be done to decrease the likelihood that problem behavior will be used.
</p>
<p>
The following will be taught in this class:
<ul>
 <li>How your actions, including well-meaning actions, can encourage problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to change your actions so that you don't encourage problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How situations in the environment can set up your child for problem behavior.</li>
 <li>How to change these situations so that your child is less likely to use problem behavior.</li> <li>How problem behavior is triggered.</li> <li>How to reduce the number of triggers for problem behavior.</li> <li>How to understand what your child is communicating through problem behavior.</li> <li>How to respond to this communication so that you don't encourage further problem behavior.</li> <li>How to take direct observational data and analyze it. This will include practice during class using video clips of problem behavior.</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
This course consists of two sessions of about 3 1/2 hours each. Each session will last from 1 p.m. until 4:30 p.m. with the first session occurring on November 7, 2009 and the second on November 14, 2009.  Please note that you will need to attend both days in order to complete the course.

<h2 id="socialskills">Social Skills and Making Friends</h2>

<h3>Presented by The Autism Society of Colorado and Sam Towers</h3>

<br>
<p>

</p><p>
Among the topics that will be covered are:
<ul>
 <li>How to determine which social skills to teach.</li>
 <li>How to prompt social skills effectively.</li>
 <li>How to provide effective feedback.</li>
 <li>How to use role-playing.</li>
 <li>How to use social stories.</li>
 <li>How to set up opportunities for practicing social skills.</li>
 <li>How to help the individual make friends.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This course will be offered from 9:30 to 4:30 on December 5, 2009.
</p><p>
All sessions will be held in the Autism Society of Colorado's training room, which is in the basement (level 1) of the First Bank building at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=550+S.+Wadsworth+Blvd,+Lakewood&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=44.25371,57.919922&ie=UTF8&ll=39.706427,-105.081482&spn=0.010549,0.014141&z=16&iwloc=addr">550 S.
